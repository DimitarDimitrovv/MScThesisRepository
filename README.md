# Master Thesis Repository for Data Science

This repository will be used to store the progress of the thesis on the topic:
Unsupervised website visitor segmentation based on Convolutional Neural Networks and k-means


Content was removed for last cleansing and will be uploaded back on Monday - 5 July 2019

Two things were done:
- Evaluated the work of Jiaming Xu et al., with the name: Short Text Clustering via Convolutional Neural Networks. They proposed an approach for training Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in an unsupervised way.

- Evaluated in-house research, within BloomReach, from Georgios Vletsas et al. with the name:
Automated Visitor Segmentation and Targeting. They applied K-modes clustering algorithm on keywords extracted from the visited, by the user, URL.

The data in the folder 'data' is based on the following Kaggle Competition - https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stackoverflow. The exact sample was taken from: https://github.com/zqhZY/short_text_cnn_cluster
